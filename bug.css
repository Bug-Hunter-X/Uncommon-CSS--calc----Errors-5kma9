The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox context might not subtract the 10px correctly if the parent element's width isn't explicitly defined. Another example is incorrect operator precedence in nested `calc()` expressions, leading to incorrect calculation results.
